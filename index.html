                    <font size="6">U</font>nless you have been living under a rock, we have all heard of the streaming service, Netflix. Although they have been dominating the market for years now, the super-giant streaming service has been declining in subscribers
                    lately. What would be the best way to bring the subscribers back? <br><br> A movie! <br><br> Okay, it might be a little more than a lack of movies. Although, a new block-buster could help them out in the short run! Theoretically, if
                    Netflix were to only put all of their bets on a single movie to bring subscribers back, it has to be a good one... <br><br> But where to begin? <br> For starters, we need to make sure that there is someone who is qualified and good
                    at their job for the creation of it. <br><br> Lets narrow our search for Netflix's new movie down into a few questions: <br><br>What directors are responsible for the highest revenue of the latest movies?<br>Who are the ten directors
                    with the highest average revenue across all of their movies?<br> And lastly, what is the best movie genre? To find this, I went over to The Movie Database (TMDB) to start retrieving data via their API. Before we go to the directors,
                    we must find what the top movies are! <br><br> This will help get not only the top grossing movies, but also help us get an idea for what genre would be the best. <br><br><img align="center" src="Graph_Money.png" alt="Top_Grossing_Movies_Graph"
                        style="max-width: 60%;"><br><br> Now that we can see the top movies, we have somewhat of an idea of what is popular! <br> Now, its time to figure out who directed these movies. I will also average out the amount of money they have
                    made across all of their movies to crunch the numbers.<br><br> <img align="center" src="Graph_Money_Directors.png" alt="Top_Directors" style="max-width: 60%;"><br><br> Perfect! <br> Now we can see who is in charge of what! Plus, we
                    can also see the average amount of money each director has made from their movies!<br><br><br> With the new knowledge, we are coming closer to finding the director needed for the job... but just to be sure, let's see if the genre itself
                    is worth investing in. <br><br><img align="center" src="genre_Graph.png" alt="Top_Genres" style="max-width: 60%;"><br <br> Adventure movies take the cake! It even blows the other top contenders like Action and Family right out of the
                    water!<br><br><br><br> With the information we acquired, We should be able to determine what Netflix should do. For starters, the safest bet for the new movie's genre would be Adventure and perhaps some other genres mixed in to make
                    it stand out. For example, one of the reasons Avengers Endgame was so successful was because of it being a mixture of <u>both</u> adventure, action and science fiction. <br><br> <br> Okay, so we have decided that Netflix is to make
                    an adventure / action movie... but who would be the best fit to direct it?<br> It looks like by a long-shot, Joe Russo would be ideal for this sort of thing. With a good amount of success and knowledge with the genre, he would be a
                    good choice. It also would not hurt to have a famous celebrity such as Dwayne Johnson, Tom Holland, Will Smith ect. <br><br><br> So there we have it! Netflix's best choice of action would be to make an Adventure / Action movie directed
                    by Joe Russo, starring a well-known likeable actor.</h2>
